# Unclosed HTML Tag Bug

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: forgetting to close a tag.  Specifically, this shows the issue of a missing closing `&lt;/p&gt;` tag for a paragraph element.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.html` file provides the corrected version.

This simple example highlights the importance of careful attention to detail when writing HTML.  Missing or mismatched tags can significantly impact the structure and rendering of your web page.
